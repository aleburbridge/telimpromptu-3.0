Features:
form where users can create their own scripts
Generate Invite Links
Pick a random script done by someone else
Vote on scripts

Flow is:
HomePage -> CreateRoomForm or JoinRoom -> WaitingRoom (assign headline writer)-> 
TopicVote -> Headline (dole out roles, dole out propmts) -> PromptFilling -> Teleprompter

TODO: 


->Voting system
    after a teleprompter is displayed, players should be able to upvote or downvote each segment. Maybe highly upvoted segments are most likely to appear for other players

->Prompt
    Have hitting "Enter" submit the prmopt
    Create a universal function that prefills any relevant script data, instead of having separate functions. this will be used for prompt serving and displaying the teleprompter


->api
    replace all utils with cloud function calls
    remove utils files
    create restrictions for api calls:  https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/api-keys#apply-restrictions


â€¢ Allow role assignment from the "any" category (but limit it? to one or two?)
â€¢ create an accessible teleprompter by room name

ðŸª² BUGS ðŸª²
â€¢ leaving room should delete you from database
- I get multiple of the same prompt
- The same user may get the same prompt because the same role was given two segments
- One role may never get segments
