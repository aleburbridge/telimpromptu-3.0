Telimpromptu, all in JavaScript. Frontend in vanilla react, styled with tailwind, database and hosting through firebase. 

Features:
form where users can create their own scripts
Generate Invite Links
Pick a random script done by someone else
Vote on scripts

Flow is:
HomePage -> CreateRoomForm or JoinRoom -> WaitingRoom (assign headline writer)-> 
TopicVote -> Headline (dole out roles, dole out propmts) -> PromptFilling -> Teleprompter

->Voting system
    after a teleprompter is displayed, players should be able to upvote or downvote each segment. Maybe highly upvoted segments are most likely to appear for other players

->Prompt shenanigans
    Create a universal function that prefills any relevant script data, instead of having separate functions. this will be used for prompt serving and displaying the teleprompter

->api shenanigans
    replace all utils with cloud function calls
    remove utils files

â€¢ submit on the prompt answering page (sometimes) hard refreshes all connected browsers - fixed?
